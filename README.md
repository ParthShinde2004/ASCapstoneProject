# ASCapstoneProject
This is a simple capstone project for AS Level Computer Science. The program will check your understanding on Stacks & Queues (along with some other CS topics) and add the user's score to a separate file.

In the future I plan to make this program better by:
- Adding a login authetication 
- Creating a highscore webpage 
- Creating a database of questions that can be used using MongoDB (pymongo)
